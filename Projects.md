## Old & Obsolete

### py2slide

Now made obsolete by rst2slide that ships with docutils, py2slide was a short and sweet slide generator based on reST, focusing on slide reuse. This is no longer available, but if you ask me I'll give you a copy. There is no reason not to use docutils instead.

### MIPSimulator

   While attending a Computer Architecture course at IC-Unicamp, I decided
   to create a tool to aid the teacher. After the course was finished I never
   had the time (or will) to work on it. So it is [available](http://codigolivre.org.br/projects/mipsimulator/)
   for anybody that might have both. 
   Note that this is a weekend's draft implementation.
